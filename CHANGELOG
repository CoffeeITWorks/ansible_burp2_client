* #15 Changes to allow use of different client path as client.
* #15 Allow to use different client path allows to use this role to setup burp client in  a burp server (to backup /etc/burp in other burp server for example or anything else).
* Added more fixes in documentation and added var `burp_client_ssl_peer_cn` as required with better documentation.
